This is an example of Astersik AMI event listener by Tim Tikijian.
It connects to the server by telnet and starts to process and save events to the Mongo DB.
There is 2 collections in DB. Events and calls.
Asterisk saves events frequently to the Events collection and after specific event chain it forms a Call 
record in Calls collection.

This code is just an example of how Astersik Events may be handled. It is NOT ready-to-use software,
because each asterisk server and his SIP-numbers, prefixes, redirects, may be configured diffrently.
But you can use AsteriskConnection and AsteriskEvent classes as a base, and build your own AteriskProcessor
on top of it.
